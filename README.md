This project will be a place where you can buy stuff from a supermarket. You can add items to your cart, view your cart, remove items, checkout, choose if you want to click and collect or have it home delivered, see how much money it costs in total. 

First you are presented with a menu that gives you 4 options, shop, view cart, checkout and exit. Shop shows you all the items in the supermarket and allows you to add the items of your choice. View cart will allow you to remove items or just simply view what items you have in your cart. Checkout will give you a “are you sure” question and after that will give you a choice between home delivery or click and collect. If you choose home delivery you will have to enter your name, street name, street number and city. THen it will ask you if all of that is correct and then show you the total amount of money you need to buy the products and it will ask you how much money you have. If you have enough money it will go though but if you dont the purchase will decline and end the program. If you choose click and collect you will have to enter your name and you phone number. Then it will say the total amount of money you will need to bring to pay for your products and it will “call” the user when its ready for pickup.
